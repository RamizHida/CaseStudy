        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          MyFlix is a web application, built with the MERN stack, that allows
          its visitors to quickly skim information about movies and directors.
          Visitors can sign up, create a list of their favorite movies, and
          delete their account at any time.

        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          MyFlix was one of several projects from my FullStack Web Development
          course, CareerFoundry. MyFlix is meant to demonstrate my Javascript
          knowledge, from Frontend to Backend.

        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>
          The goal of MyFlix was to learn how to develop a FullStack web
          application. The problem that I wanted to solve was to connect the
          client-side with the server-side to produce a fully functioning web
          application.

            <h2>Server-Side</h2>
            <p>
              By leveraging my javascript skills, I was able to use NodeJS with
              Express, to communicate with a non relational database (MongoDB)
              to develop a REST API. An Application Programming Interface (API)
              is a method in which two softwares or computer programs
              communicate with each other. My Flix’s API can be accessed by way
              of HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, and DELETE. CRUD methods were
              employed to both retrieve and store user and movie data in a non
              relational manner. The movie data that was stored in the database
              was formatted in JSON, a type of file format designed for
              transferring data across the web. I also implemented authorization
              and authentication using JSON Web Token (JWT). Authentication and
              authorization are important security processes used to protect a
              system and its data. Authenication is the process of vertifying
              that a user is the user they claim to be, while authorization is
              controling what they have access to. To ensure MyFlix's API is
              functioning as desired, I utilized Postman for testing its
              endpoints.

            <h2>Client-Side</h2>
            <p>
              With the completion of the server-side of MyFlix, I used React to
              build a Single Page Application (SPA). A Single Page Application
              (SPA) is web application that functions within a web browser and
              loads just a single document. SPAs do not require page reload
              during its usage. MyFlix’s user interface provides many page
              views, including: main view (which shows all available movies), a
              single page movie view (which shows information about the chosen
              movie), login view, signup view, favorite movie list view ,and
              account details view. By using React Bootstrap, I was able to make
              the user interface responsive and consistent between different
              page views. With the server-side code already completed, I was
              able to connect the client side with the server-side via the Fetch
              API, an interface allowing web browser to make HTTP requests to
              web servers.

        <h2>What was most enjoyable?</h2>
        <p>
          I very much enjoyed the process of setting up and connecting to a
          database. During API testing with Postman, it was exciting seeing
          MyFlix’s API responding as intended.

        <h2>What would you do differently next time?</h2>
        <p>
          When I build a similar application, with both a Frontend and a
          Backend, I would like to incorporate a relational database, such as
          MySQL.

      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          Before developing MyFlix, my natural domain was the Frontend.
          Switching to coding a backend required a different thought process all
          together. From setting up a server to serve resources to clients to
          housing data in a remote database, I was in unfamiliar terrotity. I
          particualrly struggled with implementing the feature which allows
          users to update their user info. After long hours of debugging, the
          problem turned out to be a refrencing issue, in which I forgot to
          capitilize an object's property key.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Retrospect</h2>
        <p>
          While working on this project, I solidified my understanding of what
          exactly is a full-stack application and what is required to build one.
          I learned about the four layers of Web App architecture, how the type
          of data an application is expecting affects whether a relational or
          non-relatonal database should be used, and the importance of data
          security.
